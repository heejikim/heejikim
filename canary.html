          transparency from companies. There is a growing demand for companies to take a political stand, which leads to
          consumers deciding who they will “vote” for with their money.</p>

            space within the fashion industry, and ideated business opportunities for it.</p>
          <p>We conceptualized Canary, which is a non-profit organization that represents conscious consumers, demanding
            fashion brands’ transparency, and calling out malpractices.</p>

          <p>Greenwashing refers to portraying an organization’s products, activities or policies as environmentally friendly when they are not. This practice is not only misleading, but it also distracts the industry from initiating sustainable design or circular economy initiatives.</p>
          <p>As consumers become more conscious about their purchases and supporting different causes, companies are trying to cater to this by adapting more sustainable production chain, or initiating sustainability campaign.</p>
          <p>Several companies have been called out, for claiming their businesses to be sustainable, without providing any information or statistics to back them up.</p>

          <h4>Insight 2</h4>
          <p>Many users were positive when asked “Would learning about companies that practice greenwashing make you re-evaluate your purchasing decisions?”</p>
          <p class="accent">Almost half of the users responded that they have never heard of the term greenwashing, and did not know that there was even  such concept. Some users responded that they are familiar with the concept, just not what it was called. Surprisingly, fair amount of users responded that they are aware of greenwashing campaigns, and they actively research for the companies and avoid them.</p>

          <h4>Designing for a social cause</h4>
          <p>I felt a strong connection to this project, because I fall under the target user base (Millennial), and I firmly stand by the cause of abolishing greenwashing.</p>
          <p>We know that climate change and global warming are not problems we can ignore anymore, and we know what needs to be done to even get close to solving environmental problems. So we have a cause, and we know the method. All there needs to be is a design that makes problem solving more accessible - something that informs consumers, and empower them to make more “conscious” purchasing decisions. Working through project Canary made me realize just how powerful designs can be, when they successfully function as a bridge that connects users with certain motivation to what they want to achieve.</p>
